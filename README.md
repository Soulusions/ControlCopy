### ControlCopy Discord Bot, which is forked from Soulusions.

Note:
- ⚠️ Create bot in Discord Developer Portal first
- ⚠️ Docker has not been fixed yet by Soulusions nor by me.
- ⚠️ Command are not running even though its clearly online.
- ⚠️ Bot are not ready to be used yet.

News:
- ✅ Fixed to work with Dotnet 7
- ✅ Using latest library as well (No obselete library anymore)
- ✅ Bypassed current token system as it was being worked on by Soulusions, so you can get it running atleast.

### Requirements
- [Dotnet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux) version 7

## Preparation
- Will not provide instruction for newbies.

## Running the bot
```bash
dotnet run
```

### Misc
- This is clearly still being worked on, so if you are interested in helping me and Soulusions on making the bot working nicely, feel free to do a pull request!
- I personally appreciate any issue or suggestion.
